# 0x02. Session authentication

## Background Context
In this project, you will implement a Session Authentication. You are not allowed to install any other module.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: Flask-HTTPAuth). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What authentication means
- What session authentication means
- What Cookies are
- How to send Cookies
- How to parse Cookies

## New Information
Since the beginning, all Session IDs are stored in memory. It means, if your application stops, all Session IDs are lost.

For avoid that, you will create a new authentication system, based on Session ID stored in database (for us, it will be in a file, like User)
